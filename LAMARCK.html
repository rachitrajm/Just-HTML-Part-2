Jean-Baptiste Pierre Antoine de Monet, Chevalier de la Marck, often known simply as Lamarck, was a french naturalist. He was a soldier, biologist, academic, and an early proponent of the idea that evolution occurred and proceeded in accordance with natural laws. Lamarckism (or Lamarckian inheritance) is the idea that an organism can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its offspring (also kown as heritability of acquired characteristics or soft inheritance). <br> <br> <br>
