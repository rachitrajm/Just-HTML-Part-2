, a branch of bilogy, is a subject which deals with the inheritance, as well as variation of characters from parents to offsprings. Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed on from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity. Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their parents. This results in diversity as it is created over successive generations. The original organism gives rise to individuals which are similar in body design but have slight variations. The genetic constitution of an individual organism is called its genotype, while the physical appearance is referred to as the phenotype of the individual. </b> <br> <br> <br> </font>
